Log Analyzer is a lightweight tool that scans Apache/Nginx access logs to detect suspicious or potentially malicious web activity. 
It identifies common attack patterns — such as SQL Injection, XSS, Path Traversal, File Inclusion, and Brute-Force attempts — and 
highlights them in easy-to-read terminal, JSON, or HTML reports. Designed for cybersecurity learners, system administrators, and 
DFIR workflows, this tool helps you quickly understand what kind of behavior is hitting your server and whether it may be part of an attack.
